# Heart-Disease-Detection
This repository contains a project aimed at detecting heart disease in patients using machine learning classifiers. It includes steps for data loading, feature engineering, feature selection, feature scaling, model selection, and saving the trained model.

Methodology
1. Load Dataset
Import the necessary libraries and load the dataset using pandas.
Ensure that the data is in the correct format for analysis.
2. Feature Engineering
Examine the dataset for relevant features that may contribute to heart disease detection.
Create new features if necessary (e.g., combining existing features or extracting additional insights).
Handle missing values and outliers.
3. Feature Selection
Use techniques such as correlation analysis, recursive feature elimination, or tree-based methods to identify the most important features.
Reduce dimensionality to improve model performance and interpretability.
4. Feature Scaling
Standardize or normalize the features to ensure that all input variables are on a similar scale.
This step is crucial for algorithms that are sensitive to the scale of data (e.g., SVM, k-NN).
5. Model Selection
Experiment with different machine learning classifiers such as Logistic Regression, Random Forest, Support Vector Machine, and Gradient Boosting.
Use cross-validation to evaluate model performance.
Select the best-performing model based on accuracy, precision, recall, and F1 score.
6. Save Model
Serialize the selected model using joblib or pickle to make it available for future use.
Document the modelâ€™s parameters and performance metrics for reference.
